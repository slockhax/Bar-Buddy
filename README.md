# Home Bar Buddy

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool to help manage one's home bar ingredients and recipes. I've run into the problem of having a random smattering of bottles, mixers, and ingredients at home but not always knowing what I can put together with what I have on hand. Maybe I'm out of my favorite item and haven't restocked or maybe someone gifted me something new that I've never worked with before.

I looked around for an app that would help me with this task but the few that I found didn't quite satisfy. They either didn't have the features I wanted, didn't function well overall, or had limited/poor recipes to choose from. 


## Progress

The app is a learning experience myself and currently is not complete. The core functionality is finally finished so I suppose I can say we have entered the "beta" phase.
